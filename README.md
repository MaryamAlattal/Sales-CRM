# Title: Developing an Online Booking/CRM System
# Description: The student will develop an online Customer Relationship Management and Booking system involving the design and implementation of a back-end database and a front-end interface (with both customer facing and admin functionality). It is envisaged that this will be developed using MySQL and PHP (e.g. LAMP Stack) or JavaScript-based approaches (e.g. MEAN Stack) but other development platforms could be used. This project could potentially be done in collaboration with an external company.
